# TL;DR
- During the editing process, Lurch stores cache in `iCloud Drive → Shortcuts`. As a result, your iPhone needs to be signed in with your Apple Account, with enough storage in iCloud Drive. (If you don’t have much space, you can delete the cache after using Lurch by using the `Clean cache` feature. (It’s in the … menu)
- Lurch overwrites the imported file after modifying it. (If you imported the file using a URL, it will be saved to `On My iPhone → Downloads`.)
- Lurch only supports editing IPA, TIPA files. It does not support editing encrypted IPAs. (Editing encrypted IPAs will break them from running.)
- Lurch cannot change values if the key doesn't exist or is blank.
